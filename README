This repository contains my personal solutions to some exercise quizzes 
and problems from "x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu 
(January 2020)" by Ed Jorgensen.

I added or changed some "suggested projects" to suit my own interests
but still kept the spirit of conceptual understanding within those
changes.

Even though the text is titled "with Ubuntu," I was able to use Arch 
Linux just fine.

I believe this text is freely available at
