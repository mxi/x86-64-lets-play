This repository contaians my personal solutions to some exercise
quizzes and problems from "x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with 
Ubuntu (January 2020)" by Ed Jorgensen.

I added or changed some "suggested projects" to suit my own interests
but still kept the spirit of conceptual understanding within those
changes.

Even though the text is titled "with Ubuntu," I was able to use Arch 
Linux just fine.
