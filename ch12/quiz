1)	[x] 1. Prologue (save required state);
	[x] 2. Epilogue (restore required state).

	[x] 1. Linkage (where to jump to); [where to return jump
	       to and where to return after the call.]
	2. Argument transmission (parameters).

2)	1. call <address/label>
	2. ret

3)	call-by-value
4)	call-by-reference

5)	Once

6)	1. Push $rip onto the stack;
	2. Jump to the requested address.

7)	To save/restore required registers (rbx, r12, r13, r14, r15
	rbp), and to allocate and deallocate local variables by
	adjusting $rsp. [preserved registers]

8)	%1 at $rdi
	%2 at $rsi
	%3 at $rdx
	%4 at $rcx
	%5 at $r8
	%6 at $r9

9)	%1 at $edi
	%2 at $esi
	%3 at $edx
	%4 at $ecx
	%5 at $r8d
	%6 at $r9d

10)	It need not be saved/restored by the callee.

11)	$r10, $r11 [rax, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8, r9 also
	temporaries.]

12)	Activation record; call frame

13)	It does not call any other functions inside itself.

14)	To wash out any arguments passed on the stack by the caller.

15)	24 (3*4)

16)	%7 = $rbp+16

17)	Generally none, for recursive calls: the stack size limit.

18)	call-by-reference

19)	%7 = $rbp+16
	%8 = $rbp+24

20)	They are local to the function and don't interfere with global
	state (bad practice.) [when functions are not executed, they
	do not use memory.]
