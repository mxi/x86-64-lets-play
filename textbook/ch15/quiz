1)	Stack smashing

2)	It doesn not perform bounds checking [of input
	arguments.]

3)	Yes, probably more so because of the NOP slide
	technique.

4)	Input a malicious piece of binary code and attempt
	to override either $rbp or $rip and monitor for
	suspicious behaviour or segfaults.

	[also type in many characters instead of binary]

5)	Padding malicious code with NOPs to create a larger
	surface for an attacker to guess the location of
	their inputted malicious code.

6)	1. Overwrite privileged/protected files;
	2. Open sockets to various places;
	3. etc.

7)	Canaries/stack protectors, Memory pages flagged as
	non executable (Data execution protection), Address
	space layout randomization.
